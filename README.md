## Brief introduction

Our project is a recommendation system based on collaborative filtering algorithm. 

Restaurant information is from Yelp API, which can return a limited number of restaurant nearby. 

Our database is MySQL.

Our code is mainly written in Java and the collaborative filtering part is written in Python.
  
## Instructions

We have already exposed our project to externel traffic.
